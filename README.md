- 👋 Hello, I'm @russkibrazil, texting from Brazil. This page presents a quick _about:me_.
- 👀 I got special interest in _data mining_, _data security_ and _UI/UX_ (more inclined to actively look for UX guy).
- 🌱 For now, I'm studing some basics of text mining (thanks _Coursera for Campus_) and Mercury SSE (struggling a little to grasp the authentication concepts and implement them along Symfony). In a close future, I will start learning React Native.
- 💞️ Unfortunately, my messy agenda doesn't let me actively colaborate with a project and (worse, I guess) I'm setting my own business (mouths to feed and bills to pay, you know...)
- 📫 I am available for contact through [e-mail \(igorp9971@gmail.com\)](mailto:igorp9971@gmail.com) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-pereira-5aa165120/)
